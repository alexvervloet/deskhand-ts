 * Two things happen here, and the second is the one that matters:
 *
 * 1. The output is delimited with a marker the model is told about in its
 *    system prompt.
 * 2. Any occurrence of that marker *inside* the output is neutralised first, so
 *    content cannot close its own fence and continue as if it were the system
 *    talking.
 *
 * Step 2 replaces rather than deletes, and that is a correctness requirement
 * rather than a courtesy. Deleting joins the text on either side of the marker,
 * and the join can spell the marker that was just removed:
 *
 *     body = "<<</untrusted:" + closer + token + ">>>"
 *
 * A single delete of `closer` there returns `closer`, so the body ends up
 * closing the fence after all. Substituting a placeholder keeps the two halves
 * apart, and because the placeholder contains no `<` or `>`, no marker can ever
 * span it. That is why one pass is sufficient and there is no loop to run to a
 * fixed point.
 *
 * Keeping the attempt visible is the other half. A forged marker is evidence
 * that someone tried, and it belongs in the transcript, the run viewer, and the
 * replay rather than being quietly erased.
 *
 * This does not make the content safe. A model can still be persuaded by text
 * inside the fence. What it does is remove the *structural* ambiguity — the
 * model can always tell where untrusted input begins and ends — and pair it
 * with the guarantee that actually holds: nothing in here can change a tool's
 * risk class, so the worst a persuasive ticket achieves is a refund request
 * that a human is still asked to approve.

/**
 * Replay the step log into a messages array for the next model call.
 *
 * Consecutive tool results are gathered into a single user message. That is an
 * API requirement when a turn asked for several tools at once, and getting it
 * wrong is subtle: splitting them across messages does not error, it just
 * quietly teaches the model to stop making parallel calls.
 *
 * `beforeSeq` truncates the replay, returning the conversation exactly as it
 * stood *before* that step ran. This function is a pure function of the rows
 * and the prompt — no clock, no randomness, no ambient state — which is what
 * makes "what did the model see when it decided to refund?" a question with one
 * reproducible answer, months later. See src/replay.ts.
 *
 * **`prompt` is the one message here that is not fenced**, which is only safe
 * because of what `runs.create` is careful to put in it: the ticket's reference
 * and nothing else the ticket contains. Every other byte in this array either
 * came from the model or went through `quarantine`. If a future prompt grows a
 * customer's words — a subject line, a name, a snippet "for context" — this is
 * the line that lets them in as narration, and the fence below stops being a
 * boundary the model can rely on.
