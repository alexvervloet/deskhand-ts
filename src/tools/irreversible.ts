/**
 * Irreversible tools. Money leaves, mail is delivered, an order is killed.
 *
 * Two things are true of every tool in this module:
 *
 * 1. **It cannot execute without a recorded human approval** bound to this
 *    exact run, step, and argument hash. That gate lives in the runtime, not
 *    here, so that adding a tool to this module is sufficient to protect it — a
 *    handler cannot forget to check.
 *
 * 2. **Its own preconditions are still enforced in code.** The approval gate
 *    stops the agent from acting unilaterally; it does not stop a human from
 *    clicking approve on a refund larger than the order. Policy that must
 *    always hold is a constraint here, not a sentence in the system prompt,
 *    because the prompt is advice and this is arithmetic.
 *
 *    `issue_refund` carries three such constraints, and they answer different
 *    questions. The remaining balance stops one order being refunded twice. The
 *    per-run ceiling stops one run refunding four orders once each. The daily
 *    ceiling stops four runs doing it in turn. Only the first of those was here
 *    originally, which left the total a busy afternoon could pay out bounded by
 *    nothing but a person reading approval screens carefully.
 *
 * There is no `applyInverse` for anything in this file. A refund can be
 * answered by a charge in the other direction, but that is a new decision
 * requiring its own approval, not an undo.

/**
 * Refuse a payout that breaches a ceiling, before any money moves.
 *
 * Two ceilings, and neither is the per-order remaining balance — that one is
 * about a single order being refunded twice, and it says nothing about a run
 * that refunds four different orders once each.
 *
 * The run ceiling is read off the run row, not from settings, because it was
 * snapshotted at creation. Raising the cap in a deploy must not retroactively
 * widen a run already in flight.
 *
 * This is here rather than in the runtime's bounds check for the reason the
 * module comment gives: `boundExceeded` gates model calls, and a ceiling
 * checked before the call that *proposes* a refund is not a ceiling on the
 * refund. It is checked here, at the point of payment, so it holds even when a
 * human has already clicked approve on the screen.
 *
 * The org row is locked first, and that is not decoration. The caller holds a
 * lock on the *order*, which serialises two runs fighting over one order and
 * does nothing about two runs refunding different orders of the same merchant —
 * both would read a daily total that leaves room, and both would pay. Locking
 * the merchant serialises every payout it makes. Refunds are rare enough that
 * the contention costs nothing, and a ceiling that holds only when nothing else
 * is happening is not a ceiling.
 *
 * **`for no key update`, not `for update`, and the difference is a deadlock.**
 * By the time a payout reaches this line its transaction has already inserted
 * an `audit_log` row for the approval it was granted, and that row's `org_id`
 * foreign key made Postgres take a `KEY SHARE` lock on this very org row.
 * `FOR UPDATE` conflicts with `KEY SHARE`, so asking for it here is a lock
 * *upgrade* — and two payouts for the same merchant, each holding `KEY SHARE`
 * and each waiting to upgrade, is a cycle. Postgres breaks it by killing one,
 * the worker marks that run failed, and a refund that was correct and
 * authorised simply does not happen.
 *
 * `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` conflicts with itself, which is all the ceiling needs —
 * two payouts still serialise. It does not conflict with `KEY SHARE`, so it
 * cannot deadlock against a foreign key.
